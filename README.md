# DROP

We drink about 3 liters of water every day. And we need about 120 liters for washing, brushing our teeth and cooking. But we actually consume a lot more - around 4,000 liters per day!

It's difficult to grasp where this water comes from. That's where the learning app **drop** helps. With drop you can find out
how much of the so-called virtual water is needed for the production of your food.

I developed the learning app as my final project for the web development bootcamp at neuefische.
